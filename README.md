# CSIS-1400

In this repository, I showcase solutions I have created for my labs in my CSIS-1400 class. 

For contenxt of my journey and continued education in the course, assignments will be ordered from oldest to newest in the table of contents

## Table of Contents

1. Lab v. Assignment
2. People's Weight Lab
3. Exact Change Lab
4. Soccer Team Roster

## Lab v. Assignment

Labs are different from the assignments in the fact that Labs typically have a bit of starter code, I will designate my code block from the starter code if a directory is designated as a '-lab'. Assignmnets are 100% from scratch.

Labs are done originally in ZyBooks, the online textbook used for my CSIS-1400 class. When the lab successfully passes all of the unit tests, its code will then be added to the repository within a named directory

## People's Weight Lab

The objective of this lab is to save 5 inputs into an array. From there we calculate the total weight, average, and max weight

## Exact Change Lab

The objective of this lab is to take a number (ex: 123), and then return the exact change in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies. So, for the example of 123, the program would return 1 dollar, 2 dimes, and 3 pennies.

## Soccer Team Roster

The objective of this assignment is to get user input for 5 players. Each with their respective jersey number and rating.

Ratings are between 1-9 and jerseys are between 0-99

## Fibonacci Sequence

The objective of this lab is to create a method that gives the fibonnaci of a given user number. 

Example: Fibonnacci of 7 is 13

Fibonnacci sequence is calculated by the first two places 0 and 1, and each place is calculated by the two previous places. With this logic the sequence follows as:

> 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13 ...and so on
